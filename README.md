In this Spring Boot Project I have developed backend for an e-commerce web application
Using this web app users can get information about products present int the database, also Sellers can update details about a certain product

Technologies I have used are :
Java Spring Boot Framework
PostgreSQL : for storing product details
Apache Tomcat Server
Hibernate : to map java classes to database
Lombok : to reduce lines of code
Maven : to add dependencies
